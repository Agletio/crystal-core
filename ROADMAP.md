# Crystal Core — Roadmap

**The list of work, and nothing else.** Everything that is always true lives in
`RULES.md`; the game as it stands is `CLAUDE.md`. If a thing here is not a task
or something you need in order to do one, it is in the wrong file.

Do the lowest-numbered phase that is not blocked on an open question, all of it,
then delete it from here and renumber. Numbers in a phase are intent, not
tuning — a measurement beats them.

## Phases

**Writing one.** The test is whether a session with no memory of this
conversation could execute it. That takes four things, and the second is the one
usually missing:

1. **What is true today**, named in code — the constant, the function, the file.
   "The shop sells too much" is not executable; "`RECIPES` in `src/data.ts` has
   eleven entries and should have one" is.
2. **Why it is wrong**, in one sentence a stranger would agree with. Without
   this the next session optimises the wrong thing correctly.
3. **Checkboxes that are decisions**, not tasks. "Border by base tier: white
   t1, blue t2, yellow t3" can be done wrong and caught; "improve the tooltip"
   cannot.
4. **What must not break**, and which harness proves it.

Anything you are unsure about goes in Open questions, never into a phase as an
assumption. A phase that guesses is a phase that has to be undone.

**There are none.** Everything written down has been built. What is left is the
two open questions below, which are the user's to answer, and a backlog that is
deferred by decision rather than queued — nothing comes out of it without being
asked for.

---

## Open questions

Do not guess at these.

1. **What is the fifth socket?** Wanted as an endgame slot holding something
   that is not a crystal. Deliberately unspecified — the user wants to think
   about it. `RULES.md` says how to keep it cheap to add; nothing else may
   assume it.

2. **The Cavern and the Fissure have no currency of their own.** Retiring the
   quality ladder took `sigil_of_refinement` with it, which was Prismatic's
   exclusive, and nothing replaced it. Today `sigil_of_upheaval` is gated to
   Demonic and `sigil_of_finality` to the Seam; the other two worlds are gated
   to nothing. `RULES.md` says a world should have a reason to be entered, and
   every world now has uniques of its own — the Fissure two — so this may already be
   paid. **Provisional, and mine, not the user's:** left as it is rather than
   inventing a gate. Ask before gating an existing currency to the Cavern; it
   would make a staple zone-locked.

## Backlog

Real, deferred by decision. Not a queue — do not promote one into a phase
without being asked.


- **Jewellery has three rungs but no implicit.** `amulet`/`jade_amulet`/
  `onyx_amulet` and `ring`/`silver_band`/`gold_band` differ in exactly one
  way: how many modifiers they hold. That is the clearest statement of what a
  base tier is, and it is also the least interesting pair of slots in the
  game. Implicits for them would fix that; they are a balance change, so not
  in a phase about capacity.
- **Fewer items per clear.** Measured before the tooltip and shop work: gear
  is rolled per KILL at `gearChance × yield × (1 + rarity/200)`, roughly **two
  to eleven pieces a clear** across the bands. The plan was to halve that and
  gate the three armour tiers behind power thresholds, so quantity resets down
  each time quality steps up, with gold per clear held flat across a
  threshold — crossing one must never read as a demotion.
  **The two things it was waiting on have landed.** Base tiers now gate
  themselves through item level, tooltips are readable, and Sell mode plus
  buy-back mean a heap of drops is a few clicks rather than a chore. So the
  question is now answerable rather than deferred: play it, and if it still
  feels like too much, measure the rate before changing it.
- **The opening can skip the haul step.** `take_haul` is satisfied when the
  haul is empty, and a first descent drops gear at 5% a kill — so about a
  third of the time there is nothing to take and the step the opening exists
  to teach is silently skipped. `npm run guide` passes either way, which is
  the part that makes it worth writing down. The fix is probably a guaranteed
  first drop rather than a change to the step.
- **No per-item "keep" rule for the haul.** Every drop goes to the haul and
  triage is manual. A filter that hides a drop is the kind of thing you only get
  right once you know what a good drop looks like — and now that uniques drop,
  the answer has moved.
- **Blight and Strike are not the same game.** Last measured, Blight cleared
  the top of the ladder 12/12 where Strike managed 3/12. That number is OLD —
  it predates the capacity rework, the retune and everything since — so
  re-measure before acting on it.
- More tutorial steps for systems added since the opening was written: the
  collection screen, the bench's crystals column, sell mode, the counter.
- **A third way to get rid of a piece.** Selling is now a mode with a buy-back
  behind it, which is enough that this is no longer urgent — but everything
  still ends at the same counter, and a game where the only verb is "sell" has
  one verb.
- Four-frame walks for the bestiary, if the creatures ever grow legs worth
  animating.
- **A drawn recovery frame per creature.** They have one `attack` grid each and
  hold it for the whole swing. The hero does not — `poseOf` indexes
  `SWING_POSES` by how far through the swing the entity is — so the fix is that
  same treatment plus 21 more grids in `src/render/bestiary.ts`.
